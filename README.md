# K8s Infra

Kubernetes infrastructure for personal projects.

## Installation

As a gateway [nginx-gateway-fabric](https://github.com/nginx/nginx-gateway-fabric) is used. Have a look at the documentation for the [installation steps](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-gateway-fabric/install/manifests/), so the cluster supports the gateway.
